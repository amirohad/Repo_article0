# Repo_article0: Force measurement setup code repository

* Use article0_notebook2 notebook to run analysis on trajectory.

* Exp2_supplementary_measurements_article0_xl.xlsx has misc. information on each plant (and event) need to complete geometric information.

* Calibration data can be located in the Force calibration data 1 folder.

* Inherent noise data is available in the CSRT_fluctuations text file. 

* 4 3D-print files are included in the 'lens add-on' folder.

* See video S1 for side and top view angles of contact during force application, with a graph of the changing force over time (30s/frame).
